/**
 * Methods you override that are part of component creation (onCreate(), onStart(), onResume(), etc.),
 * you should chain to the superclass as the first statement,
 * to ensure that Android has its chance to do its work before you attempt to do something that relies upon that work having been done.
 * Methods you override that are part of component destruction (onPause(), onStop(), onDestroy(), etc.),
 * you should do your work first and chain to the superclass as the last thing.
 * That way, in case Android cleans up something that your work depends upon, you will have done your work first.
 * Methods that return something other than void (onCreateOptionsMenu(), etc.),
 * sometimes you chain to the superclass in the return statement,
 * assuming that you are not specifically doing something that needs to force a particular return value.
 * Everything else -- such as onActivityResult() -- is up to you, on the whole. tend to chain to the superclass as the first thing,
 * but unless you are running into problems, chaining later should be fine.
 * <p/>
 * If you want to be clear when do you want to call a method you need before or after super call.
